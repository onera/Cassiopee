    <h3>Preamble</h3>

    This module provides functions to distribute blocks on a given 
    number of processors. At the end of the process, each block
    will have a number corresponding to the processor it must be affected
    to for a balanced computation, depending on given criterias. This
    module doesn't perform splitting (see the Transform module for
    that).<br><br>

    This module is part of Cassiopee, a free open-source 
    pre- and post-processor for CFD simulations.<br><br>

    To use the module with the Converter array interface, you must import it as:
    <div class="code">
    import Distributor2 as D2 
    </div>
    To use the module with the pyTree interface, you must import it as:
    <div class="code">
    import Distributor2.PyTree as D2 
    </div>
        
    <p></p>
    <h3>Automatic load balance</h3>
    <p></p>
    <strong>D2.distribute</strong>:
    distribute automatically the blocks amongst N processors. <br>
    With the array interface, where A is a list of blocks:<br>

    - prescribed is a list of blocks that are forced to be on a given processor. 
    prescribed[2] = 0 means that block 2 MUST be affected to processor 0.<br>
    - perfo is a tuple or a tuple list for each 
    processor. Each tuple describes the relative weight of solver CPU time 
    regarding the communication speed and latence (solverWeight, latenceWeight,
    comSpeedWeight). <br>
    - weight is a list of weight for each block indicating the relative cost
    for solving each block. <br>
    - com is a ixj matrix describing the volume of points
    exchanged between bloc i and bloc j. <br> 
    Algorithm can be chosen in: 'gradient', 'genetic', 'fast'.<br><br>

    The function output is a stats dictionary.
    stat['distrib'] is a vector describing the attributed processor for each 
    block, stats['meanPtsPerProc'] is the mean number of points per proc,
    stats['varMin'] is the minimum variation of number of points,
    stats['varMax'] is the maximum variation of number of points,
    stats['varRMS'] is the mean variation of number of points,
    stats['nptsCom'] is the number of points exchanged between processors for
    communication, stats['comRatio'] is the ratio of points exchanged between 
    processors in this configuration divided by the total number of points
    needed in communications,
    stats['adaptation'] is the value of the optimized function:
    <div class="code">
      stats = D2.distribute(A, NProc, prescribed=[], perfo=[], weight=[], com=[],
      algorithm='gradient', nghost=0)
    </div>
    With the pyTree interface, the user-defined node .Solver#Param/proc 
    is updated with the attributed processor number.<br> 
    If useCom=0, only the grid number of points is taken into account.<br>
    If useCom='all', matching and overlap communications are taken into account. <br>
    If useCom='match', only match connectivity are taken into account.<br>
    if useCom='overlap', only overlap connectivity are taken into account.<br>
    if useCom='bbox', overlap between zone bbox is taken into account.<br>

    When using distributed trees, prescribed must be a dictionary containing 
    the zones names as key, and the prescribed proc as value.  
    weight is also a dictionary where the keys are the zone names and the weight as the value.
    It is not mandatory to assign a weight to all the zones of the pyTree. Default value is assumed 1,
    only different weight values can be assigned to zones. 
    t can be either a skeleton or a loaded skeleton pyTree for useCom=0 or useCom='match', 
    but must be a loaded skeleton tree only for the other settings:
    <div class="code">
    t, stats = D2.distribute(t, NProc, prescribed={}, perfo=[], weight={}, useCom='all', algorithm='gradient')
    </div>

    <h3>Various operations</h3>
    <p></p>

    <strong>D2.addProcNode</strong>:
    add a "proc" node to all zones of A with given value:
    <div class="code">
    B = D2.addProcNode(A, 12)
    </div>
    <em>Example of use: </em><a href="Examples/Distributor2/addProcNodePT.py"> add a proc node (pyTree).</a><br><br> 

    <strong>D2.getProc</strong>:
    get the proc node of a zone or a list of zones:
    <div class="code">
    proc = D2.getProc(a) <em>.or.</em> [proc1,proc2,...] = D2.getProc(A)
    </div>
    <em>Example of use: </em><a href="Examples/Distributor2/getProcPT.py"> get proc of a zone (pyTree).</a><br><br> 

    <strong>D2.getProcList</strong>:
    return procList where procList[proc] is a list of zone names
    attributed to the proc processor: 
    <div class="code">
    procList = D2.getProcList(A, NProc=None)
    </div>
    <em>Example of use: </em><a href="Examples/Distributor2/getProcListPT.py"> return the list of zones attributed to a proc (pyTree).</a><br><br> 
    
    <strong>D2.copyDistribution</strong>:
    copy the distribution of B to A matching zones by their name:
    <div class="code">
    A = D2.copyDistribution(A, B)
    </div>
    <em>Example of use: </em><a href="Examples/Distributor2/copyDistributionPT.py"> copy distribution from one tree to another (pyTree).</a><br><br> 

    <strong>D2.redispatch</strong>:
    redispatch a tree where a new distribution is defined in the node 'proc': 
    <div class="code">
    B = D2.redispatch(A)
    </div>
    <em>Example of use: </em><a href="Examples/Distributor2/redispatchPT.py"> redispatch a tree (pyTree).</a><br><br>
