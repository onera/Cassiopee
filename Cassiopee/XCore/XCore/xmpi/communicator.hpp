 *    \brief This class manages the data message exchanges ( point to point or
 * collective )
 *           inside a communication group.
 *
 *    The communicator class create instances which group some processes
 *    together. Two ways to create an instance of communicator class :
 *    1. With the default constructor : a global communicator instance is
 *       created which contains all processes executed in the parallel session
 *    2. With a color and a key : to create a partition of the processes in
 *       several communicators.
 *
 *    Probably than future versions of the library will provide other
 *    services to create new groups.

   *
   *   This constructor instances a new communicator by splitting
   *   the communicator \ref com into a group of sub--communicators
   *   based on the input values \ref color and \ref key. It's important
   *   to note here that the original communicator doesn't go away,
   *   but a new communicator is created on each process.
   *
   *   \param com   It's the communicator that will be used as the basis
   *                for the new communicators
   *   \param color Determines to which new communicator each processes
   *                will belong. All processes which pass in the same
   *                value for \ref color are assigned to the same
   *                communicator. If the color is the constant undefined,
   *                that process won't be included in any of the new
   *                communicators.
   *   \param key   Determines the ordering ( rank ) within each
   *                new communicator. The process which passes in the
   *                smallest value for \ref key will be rank 0, the
   *                next smallest will be rank 1, and so on. If there is
   *                a tie, the process that had the lower rank in the original
   *                communicator will be first.
