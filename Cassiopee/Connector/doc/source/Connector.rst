Connector: Grid connectivity module
=============================================


Preamble
######## 

Connector module is used to compute connectivity between meshes.
It manipulates arrays (as defined in Converter documentation)
or CGNS/Python trees (pyTrees) as data structures.

This module is part of Cassiopee, a free open-source
pre- and post-processor for CFD simulations.


To use the Connector module with the array interface::

    import Connector as X 

With the pyTree interface::

    import Connector.PyTree as X 

.. py:module:: Connector

Multiblock connectivity
-------------------------

.. py:function:: Connector.connectMatch

    Detect and set all matching windows, even partially.

    *Using the array interface:*

        ::

         res = X.connectMatch(a1, a2, sameZone=0, tol=1.e-6, dim=3)

        Detect and set all matching windows between two structured arrays a1 and a2.
        Return the subrange of indices of abutting windows and an index transformation from a1 to a2.
        If the CFD problem is 2D, then dim must be set to 2.
        Parameter sameZone must be set to 1 if a1 and a2 define the same zone.

    :param a1,a2:  Input data
    :type  a1,a2:  arrays
    
    *Using the PyTree interface:*

        ::

         t = X.connectMatch(t, tol=1.e-6, dim=3, type='all')
        
        Detect and set all matching windows in a zone node, a list of zone nodes or a complete pyTree.
        Set automatically the Transform node corresponding to the transformation from matching block 1 to block 2.

    :param t: input data
    :type  t: pyTree, base, zone, list of zones
    :param tol: geometrical tolerance between abutting zones
    :type tol: float
    :param dim: dimension of the problem (2 or 3, only for structured grids)
    :type dim: integer
    :param type: can be 'structured', 'unstructured', 'hybrid' or 'all'
    :type type: string
    :rtype:  identical to input

    Exists also as parallel distributed version (X.Mpi.connectMatch).


    *Example of use:*

    * `Detect matching boundaries of a mesh (array) <Examples/Connector/connectMatch.py>`_:

    .. literalinclude:: ../build/Examples/Connector/connectMatch.py

    * `Add 1-to-1 abutting connectivity in a pyTree (pyTree) <Examples/Connector/connectMatchPT.py>`_:

    .. literalinclude:: ../build/Examples/Connector/connectMatchPT.py

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. py:function:: Connector.PyTree.connectMatchPeriodic(t, rotationCenter=[0.,0.,0.], rotationAngle=[0.,0.,0.], translation=[0.,0.,0.], tol=1.e-6, dim=3, unitAngle=None)

    Detect and set all periodic matching borders, even partially, in a zone node, a list of zone nodes, a base, or a full pyTree.
    Periodicity can be defined either by rotation or translation or by a composition of rotation and translation.


    :param t: input data
    :type  t: pyTree, base, zone, list of zones
    :param tol: geometrical tolerance between periodical abutting zones
    :type tol: float
    :param dim: dimension of the problem (2 or 3, only for structured grids)
    :type dim: integer
    :param rotationCenter: coordinates of the rotation center for periodicity by rotation
    :type rotationCenter: list of 3 floats
    :param translation: translation vector for periodicity by translation
    :type translation: list of 3 floats
    :param rotationAngle: rotation angle, the only one non-zero provides the rotation axis
    :type rotationAngle: list of 3 floats
    :param unitAngle: angle unit ('Degree' or 'Radian' or None). None means 'Degree' (default value).
    :type unitAngle: float
    :rtype:  identical to input


    Set automatically the Transform node corresponding to the transformation from matching block 1 to block 2, and the 'GridConnectivityProperty/Periodic' for periodic matching BCs.

    For periodicity by rotation, the rotation angle units can be specified by argument unitAngle, which can be 'Degree','Radian',None.

    If unitAngle=None or 'Degree': parameter rotationAngle is assumed to be defined in degrees.

    If unitAngle='Radian': parameter rotationAngle is assumed in radians.

    Exists also as parallel distributed version (X.Mpi.connectMatchPeriodic).

    .. note:: 

      - if the mesh is periodic in rotation and in translation separately (i.e. connecting with some blocks in rotation, and some other blocks in translation), the function must be applied twice.

      - Since *Cassiopee2.6*: 'RotationAngle' node in 'Periodic' node is always defined in Radians. A DimensionalUnits child node is also defined.
    

    *Example of use:*

    * `Add periodic  1-to-1 abutting grid connectivity in a pyTree (pyTree) <Examples/Connector/connectMatchPeriodicPT.py>`_:

    A 'UserDefinedData' node is set, with the PointRangeDonor, the Transform and NMRatio nodes providing information for the opposite zone.
    .. warning:: connectMatch must be applied first if matching windows exist.

    Parameter ratio defines the ratio between near-matching windows and can be an integer (e.g. 2) or a list of 3 integers (e.g. [1,2,1]), specifying
    the nearmatching direction to test (less CPU-consuming).
    If the CFD problem is 2D, then dim must be set to 2.
    

    :param t: input data
    :type  t: pyTree, base, zone, list of zones
    :param ratio: defines the 1-over-ratio abutting grids in all the directions

    :type tol: float
    :param dim: dimension of the problem (2 only valid for structured grids)
    :type dim: integer
    :rtype:  identical to input

.. py:function:: Connector.PyTree.setDegeneratedBC(t, dim=3, tol=1.e-10)

    Detect all degenerated lines in 3D zones and define a BC as a 'BCDegenerateLine' BC type. For 2D zones, 'BCDegeneratePoint'
    type is defined.
    If the problem is 2D according to (i,j), then parameter 'dim' must be set to 2.

.. py:function:: Connector.blankCells()

    Blank cells using X-Ray method.
    
    *Using the array interface:*

        ::

          cellns = X.blankCells(coords, cellns, body, blankingType=2, delta=1.e-10, dim=3, masknot=0, tol=1.e-8)

        Blank the cells of a list of grids defined by coords (located at nodes).
        The X-Ray mask is defined by bodies, which is a list of arrays.
        Cellnaturefield defined in cellns is modified (0: blanked points, 1: otherwise).
        Some parameters can be specified: blankingType, delta, masknot, tol. Their meanings are described in the table below:

        +---------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        |  Parameter value          |  Meaning                                                                         | 
        +===========================+==================================================================================+
        |    blankingType=0         |  blank nodes inside bodies (node_in).                                            | 
        +---------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        |    blankingType=2         |  blank cell centers inside bodies (center_in).                                   |

        |                           |  and interpolation depth=2 (blanking region may be reduced where blanking point  | 
        |                           |  can be interpolated).                                                           | 
        +---------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        |    blankingType=-1        |  blank cell centers using an optimized cell intersection (cell_intersect_opt)    | 
        |                           |  and interpolation depth=1.                                                      | 
        +---------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        |    delta=0.               |  cells are blanked in the body                                                   |

        +---------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


        .. note:: in case of blankingType=0, location of cellns and coords must be identical.
    
    *Using the pyTree interface:*
        ::

         B = X.blankCells(t, bodies, BM, depth=2, blankingType='cell_intersect', delta=1.e-10, dim=3, tol=1.e-8, XRaydim1=1000, XRaydim2=1000)


        **blankCells** function sets the cellN to 0 to blanked nodes or cell centers of both structured and unstructured grids.

        The location of the cellN field depends on the *blankingType* parameter: if 'node_in' is used, nodes are blanked, else centers are blanked.

        The mesh to be blanked is defined by a pyTree t, where each basis defines a Chimera component. The list of bodies blanking the grids is defined in bodies.

        Each element of the list bodies is a set of CGNS/Python zones defining a closed and watertight surface.

        The blanking matrix BM is a numpy array of size nbases x nbodies.

        BM(i,j)=1 means that ith basis is blanked by jth body.

        BM(i,j)=0 means no blanking, and BM(i,j)=-1 means that inverted hole-cutting is performed.

        blankingType can be 'cell_intersect', 'cell_intersect_opt', 'center_in' or 'node_in'. Parameter depth is only meaningfull for 'cell_intersect_opt'.

        XRaydim1 and XRaydim2 are the dimensions of the X-Ray hole-cutting in the x and y directions in 3D.

        If the variable 'cellN' does not exist in the input pyTree, it is initialized to 1, located at 'nodes' if 'node_in' is set, and at centers in other cases.

        .. warning:: 'cell_intersect_opt' can be CPU time-consuming when delta>0.

    *Example of use:*

    * `Blank cells (array) <Examples/Connector/blankCells.py>`_:

    .. literalinclude:: ../build/Examples/Connector/blankCells.py

    * `Blank cells (pyTree) <Examples/Connector/blankCellsPT.py>`_:

    .. literalinclude:: ../build/Examples/Connector/blankCellsPT.py

.. py:function:: Connector.blankCellsTetra()

    *Using the array interface:*

        ::

          cellns = X.blankCellsTetra(coords, cellns, body, blankingType=2, tol=1.e-12)
    

        Blanks the input grids nodes or cells (depending on the *blankingType* value) that fall inside a volume body mask.
        The blanking is achieved by setting the Cellnaturefield to *cellnval* (0 by default) in *cellns*.
        
        The input grids are defined by coords located at nodes as a list of arrays. The body mask is defined by sets of tetrahedra in any orientation, as a list of arrays.

        If the *blankingMode* is set to 1 (overwrite mode), Cellnaturefield is reset to 1 for any node/cell outside the body mask.
        Hence the value of 1 is forbidden for cellnval upon entry (it will be replaced by 0).

        The parameters meanings and values are described in the table below:

        +---------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        |  Parameter value          |  Meaning                                                                         |

        +---------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        |  blankingType=2           |  blanks the cells having their center falling inside the body masks (center_in). | 
        +---------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        |  blankingType=1           |  blanks the cells that intersect or fall inside the body masks (cell_intersect). |

        The blanking matrix BM is a numpy array of size nbases x nbodies.

        BM(i,j)=1 means that ith basis is blanked by jth body.

        BM(i,j)=0 means no blanking, and BM(i,j)=-1 means that inverted hole-cutting is performed.

        blankingType can be 'cell_intersect', 'center_in' or 'node_in'.

        If the variable 'cellN' does not exist in the input pyTree, it is initialized to 1, located at 'nodes' if 'node_in' is set, and at centers in other cases.

        Each element of the list bodies is a set of CGNS/Python zones defining a triangular watertight closed surface. 
        
        The blanking matrix BM is a numpy array of size nbases x nbodies.

        BM(i,j)=1 means that ith basis is blanked by jth body.

        BM(i,j)=0 means no blanking, and BM(i,j)=-1 means that inverted hole-cutting is performed.

        blankingType can be 'cell_intersect', 'center_in' or 'node_in'.

        If the variable 'cellN' does not exist in the input pyTree, it is initialized to 1, located at 'nodes' if 'node_in' is set, and at centers in other cases.

        If the *overwrite* is set to 1 (overwrite mode), Cellnaturefield is reset to 1 for any node/cell outside the body mask.

        Hence the value of 1 is forbidden for cellnval upon entry (it will be replaced by 0).

        If dir=0, uses a directional stencil of depth points, if dir=1, uses a star shape stencil,
        if dir=2, uses a diamond stencil, if dir=3, uses an octahedron stencil.
        Blanked points are identified by the variable 'cellN'; 'cellN' is set to 2 for the fringe of interpolated points.
        If cellN is located at cell centers, set loc parameter to 'centers', else loc='nodes'.

.. py:function:: Connector.optimizeOverlap()

    *Using the array interface:*

        ::

         cellns = X.optimizeOverlap(nodes1, centers1, nodes2, centers2, prio1=0, prio2=0)

        Optimize the overlap between two zones defined by nodes1 and nodes2, centers1 and centers2 correspond to the mesh located at centers and the field 'cellN'.
        The field 'cellN' located at centers is set to 2 for interpolable points.
        Priorities can be defined for zones: prio1=0 means that the priority of zone 1 is high.
        If two zones have the same priority, then the cell volume criterion is used to set the cellN to 2 for one of the overlapping cells, the other not being modified.
        If the priorities are not specified, the cell volume criterion is applied also:

    *Using the pyTree interface:*

        ::

         t = X.optimizeOverlap(t, double_wall=0, priorities=[], planarTol=0., intersectionsDict=None)

        Optimize the overlapping between all structured zones defined in a pyTree t.
        The 'cellN' variable located at cell centers is modified, such that cellN=2 for a cell interpolable from another zone. 
        Double wall projection technique is activated if 'double_wall'=1. Parameter planarTol can be useful for double wall cases, 
        in the case when double wall surfaces are planar but distant from planarTol to each other.  
        The overlapping is optimized between zones from separated bases, and is based on a priority to the cell of smallest size.
        One can impose a priority to a base over another base, using the list priorities.
        For instance, priorities = ['baseName1',0, 'baseName2',1] means that zones from base of name 'baseName1' are preferred over
        zones from base of name 'baseName2':

    This function is specific to elsA solver.
    Set the Chimera connectivity (EX points and cell centers to be interpolated, index for donor interpolation cell and interpolation coefficients). 
    Double wall projection technique is activated if 'double_wall=1'.
    Parameter planarTol can be useful for double wall cases, in the case when double wall surfaces are planar but distant from planarTol to each other.  
    Parameter 'sameBase=1' means that donor zones can be found in the same base as the current zone. 

    parallelDatas=[graph,rank,listOfInterpCells] is defined only in a coupling context. It contains the graph of communication, the rank of the current processor and the list of interpolated cells/faces indices.  graph is a Python dictionary with the following structure : graph[proc1][proc2] gives the list of zones on processeur 1 which intersect with zones on processor 2. 
    loc='cell' or 'face' indicates the location of the interpolated points (cell center or face).
    Interpolations with location at 'face' correspond to interpolation for EX points according to elsA solver.

    storage can be 'direct' (interpolation data stored in receptor zones) or 'inverse' (data stored in donor zones). Value storage='direct' is only valid if Chimera connectivity is read by elsA solver as Chimera connectivity files.

    In a distributed mode, the storage must be necessarily 'inverse'. If the Chimera connectivity is read by elsA directly as CGNS ZoneSubRegion_t nodes, then the storage must be 'inverse' too. 
    prefixFile is the prefix for the name of the connectivity files generated for elsA solver (solver='elsA') or Cassiopee solver (solver='Cassiopee'). If prefixFile is not specified by the user, no Chimera connectivity file is dumped. 

    nGhostCells is the number of ghost cells that are required by elsA solver when writing connectivity files. Can be greater than 2 only if elsA reads the Chimera connectivity files.
    cfMax is a threshold value for a valid extrapolation: if the sum of the extrapolated coefficients is greater than cfMax, then the cell is marked as orphan.

    parallelDatas: used to perform setInterpolations in a distributed context : a list of communication information [graph, rank, interpPts], where interpPts is the list of interpolated cells/EX points.

    For Euler computations, corrected points are inside body, for viscous computations,
    corrected points are outside body.

    :param t:  pyTree defining the computational domain as a structured mesh
    :type  t:  pyTree 
    :param tb: pyTree defining the obstacles. Each obstacle must be defined in a CGNS basis as a surface closed mesh, whose normals must be oriented towards
               the fluid region
    :type  tb: pyTree 
    :param DEPTH: number of layers of IBM corrected points (usually 2 meaning 2 ghost cells are required)
    :type DEPTH: integer
    :param loc: location of IBM points: at nodes if loc='nodes' or at cell centers if loc='centers' ('centers'default)
    :type loc: string
    :param frontType: 0: constant distance front, 1: minimum distance front, 2: adapted distance front
    :type frontType: integer [0-2]
    :return: t, tc
    :rtype: pyTree

    The problem dimension (2 or 3D) and the equation model (Euler, Navier-Stokes or RANS) are required in tb.

    Output datas are:

    - the pyTree t with a 'cellN' field located at nodes or centers, marking as computed/updated/blanked points for the solver (cellN=1/2/0).

    - a donor pyTree tc storing all the information required to transfer then the solution at cellN=2 points:
   
    *Example of use:* 

    * `compute the IBM preprocessing (pyTree) <Examples/Connector/prepareIBMDataPT.py>`_:

    .. literalinclude:: ../build/Examples/Connector/prepareIBMDataPT.py

    .. warning:: requires Connector.ToolboxIBM.py module.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. py:function:: Connector.ToolboxIBM.extractIBMInfo(a)

    Extract the IBM particular points once the IBM data is computed and stored in a pyTree. These points are the IBM points that are marked
    as updated points for the IBM approach and the corresponding wall and interpolated (in fluid) points.

    If information is stored in the donor pyTree tc, then a=tc, else a must define the receptor pyTree t.

    *Example of use:* 

    * `extract all the IBM points (pyTree) <Examples/Connector/extractIBMInfoPT.py>`_:

    .. literalinclude:: ../build/Examples/Connector/extractIBMInfoPT.py

    .. warning:: requires Connector.ToolboxIBM.py module.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. py:function:: Connector.ToolboxIBM.extractIBMWallFields(a,tb=None)

    Extract the solution at walls. If IBM data is stored in donor pyTree tc, then a must be tc, else a is the pyTree t.

    If tb is None, then tw is the cloud of wall points. If tb is a triangular surface mesh, then the solution extracted at cloud points is interpolated
    on the vertices of the triangular mesh. a must contain the fields in the ZoneSubRegions of name prefixed by 'IBCD'. 

    *Example of use:* 

    * `Extract the solution on the wall  (pyTree) <Examples/Connector/extractIBMWallFieldsPT.py>`_:

    .. literalinclude:: ../build/Examples/Connector/extractIBMWallFieldsPT.py
 
    .. warning:: requires Connector.ToolboxIBM.py module.

Overset and Immersed Boundary transfers with pyTrees
----------------------------------------------------

    The following function enables to update the solution at some points, marked as interpolated for overset and IBM approaches.


 .. py:function:: Connector.PyTree.setInterpTransfers(aR, topTreeD, variables=None, variablesIBC=['Density', 'MomentumX', 'MomentumY', 'MomentumZ', 'EnergyStagnationDensity'], bcType=0, varType=1, storage='unknown')

    General transfers from a set of donor zones defined by topTreeD to receptor zones defined in aR.

    Both Chimera and IBM transfers can be applied and are identified by the prefix name of the ZoneSubRegion node
    created when computing the overset or IBM interpolation data.

    Parameter variables is the list of variable names that are transfered by Chimera interpolation.

    Parameter variablesIBC defines the name of the 5 variables used for IBM transfers.

    Parameter bcType can be 0 or 1 (see table below for details).

    Parameter varType enables to define the meaning of variablesIBC, if their name is not standard (see table below for more details).

    Parameter storage enables to define how the information is stored (see table below).
