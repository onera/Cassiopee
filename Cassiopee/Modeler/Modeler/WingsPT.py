    '''
    This function builds an airplane's wing section by section, using typical
    aerodynamic parameters. The result is a structured surface.

    sections : List of sections defining each airfoil, with its corresponding
    chord length. The minimum amount of sections needed to define a wing is 2
    (root and tip). Use the airfoil() function to define and discretize the 
    airfoils as you wish. Beware that the total number of points of each airfoil
    must be the same.

    span : It is a list defining the wingspan between two consecutive sections.

    washout : angle of the downwards twist of the wing at each section. You may
    only choose to give one angle of washout, and it will act as a rotation of
    the whole wing.

    sweep : backwards sweepangle of each section. Only one value imposes a single
    sweep angle for the whole wing.

    dihedral : angle of the upwards dihedral of the wing at each section. Only 
    one value imposes a single dihedral angle for the whole wing.

    distribution : Dictionnary of distribution similar to the ones used in
    linelaw. It is used to control de discretisation in the span-coordinate
    between two consecutive wing sections. If only one distribution is provided,
    the distribution will be the same for each wing element (portion of wing
    between two consecutive sections). You shall provide the keyword 'points' in
    order to impose the number of discretization points.

    sectionShapeLaw : It controls the law imposed to interpolate the airfoils 
    between two sections. Can be ‘linear’, ‘nearest’, ‘zero’, ‘slinear’, 
    ‘quadratic‘ or ‘cubic’. Recommended value is 'linear' for trapezoidal-like
    wings. For complex geometries with non-linear interpolations, the user may
    prefer to use the function sweepSections().
    ______________
    Important note: wing supposes that the input sections are positioned in the
    XY plane. The reference point from which the washout, dihedral and sweep 
    angles are applied is the origin (0,0,0), which corresponds by default to 
    the Leading Edge of the airfoil. If you wish to re-position this reference,
    you may apply a translation to the wing sections beforehand.

    This function builds a sweep surface from a given profile, or a set of
    profiles, throughout a spine. The result is a structured surface.

    sections : List of sections that will be used to sweep around the spine.
    Beware that the total number of points of each section must be the same.

    SpanPositions : Vector between 0 and 1, with the same number of elements as
    the number of sections. It is used to place each section at the wished 
    position along the spine. If not provided, sections are distributed
    uniformely.

    rotation : Vector of twist angles imposed to the profiles along the spine. 
    You may use a single value, and the imposed rotation will be the same 
    throughout the spine. You may use only two values, and the rotation will be
    distributed linearly from start to end. You may use the same number of values
    as the number of sections, then the twist angle is imposed following the law
    (rotationLaw) at each section's position.

    rotationLaw : It controls the law imposed to interpolate the rotation 
    between two sections. Can be ‘linear’, ‘nearest’, ‘zero’, ‘slinear’, 
    ‘quadratic‘ or ‘cubic’. 

    NormalDirection : 3 element vector describing the extrusion orientation
    used to find the local reference frame. As the sections are supposed to be
    placed in the XY plane, this vector will typically be (0,0,1).

    spine : 1D curve where the sections will be swept along. The spine-wise 
    discretization is exactly the same as the node distribution of the spine. 
    Hence, if you wish to control the discretization along the spine, change 
    your spine preferrably with linelaw or spinelaw.
