    <h3>Preamble</h3>
    
    tkCassiopee is the graphical user interface to Cassiopee modules. <br><br>

    The application
    is made from different applets. Applets are stored in tabs (Tree, 
    State, Edge, Surf, ...). <br>
    <br>

    To call the application from shell:
    <div class="code">
      cassiopee file
    </div>

    <p></p>
    <h3>General guidelines</h3>
    <p></p>
    Each applet can be triggered from top menu <b>Apps</b> or
    by right clicking on a tab. It can be
    discarded by left clicking on its name at top of frame or by pressing
    CTRL+c.<br>
    The default settings of an applet can be modified in the preference file
    by right clicking on the applet name and chosing 'save'.
    Settings can be reset by chosing 'reset' in the menu.
    An applet can be pinned, meaning that it will automatically
    be opened at next restart.
    <br>
    The graphical window is called the CPlot window. You can rotate
    your model using left mouse button. You can move your model
    using left mouse button. You can tilt the model by pressing
    CTRL+right mouse button. You can move the way your looking without
    modifying your position by pressing CTRL+left mouse button.
    View can be quickly centered by left double clicking.
    <br>

    A zone can be selected by using 
    SHIFT + left mouse button, can be deactivated using 
    SHIFT + right mouse button. Multiple selection is available
    by pressing SHIFT + CTRL + left mouse button or by draging
    mouse with SHIFT pressed. <br>

    Some CPlot functions are available through the <b>CPlot</b>
    top menu. Other functions are described in the CPlot module
    documentation.<br>

    Generally, functions of the applet work on selected zones.<br>

    One level-undo is available in the <b>CPlot</b> top menu or by pressing 
    CTRL+z or by pressing the back arrow in the tool bar.<br>
    You can chose the location of displayed data (node/center) for
    structured zones by clicking on 'change displayed location'
    in the <b>CPlot</b> top menu. <br>
    Selecting 'Quit' in <b>File</b> top menu exits cassiopee. You can
    also exits by pressing 'q' when in CPlot window. <br>

    <p></p>
    <h3>Cassiopee:ToolBar</h3>

    <p></p>
    <h3>Cassiopee:Tree</h3>
    <p></p>
    This tab gathers applets related to pyTree management.<br>

    In tkTree window, left mouse button
    selects zone, right mouse button deactivates/activates zone,
