<h1>Dist2Walls: computes the distance field for elsA computations</h1>
<h2><em> Cassiop√©e tutorials</em></h2>
<hr>
<p>
    This tutorial demonstrates how to compute the distance to walls in a pyTree
   and dump the distance fields to files for further reading by elsA solver. 
   If the 'cellN' variable (located at centers, cellN=0 for blanked cells, 
   cellN=2 for interpolated cells, cellN=1 for computed cells) is defined in 
   the pyTree, 
   then it is taken into account during the distance field computation. If a 
   cell near the wall is blanked, then the corresponding wall face is not used 
   for the distance computation.<br>

<strong> Compute the distance field for a multiblock structured mesh around a sphere.</strong><br><br><br>
</center>

<p>
   In the script, wall boundaries are first extracted as 2D zones using 
   <span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;">C.extractBCOfType</span> of Converter module.

   To compute the wall distance, one can use the walls in nodes, in centers or in extended centers
   using 
   <span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;">C.node2Center</span> or
   <span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;">C.node2ExtCenter</span>.
   
   Finally, fonction <span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;">DTW.distance2Walls</span>
   is used to compute the distance located at centers in the multiblock mesh defined as a pyTree, using "ortho" or
   "mininterf" algorithm.   

   To obtain results similar to the distance computed by elsA Kernel, one must choose walls in centers and "mininterf" algorithm.
  
 
   <br>
   The result is the creation of a 'TurbulentDistance' node in the pyTree.<br>
   Finally, these nodes can be dumped to files which can be read by elsA Kernel.<br><br>
