<h1>Dist2Walls: computes the distance field with a distributed tree</h1>
<h2><em> Cassiop√©e tutorials</em></h2>
<hr>
<p>
    This tutorial demonstrates how to compute the distance to walls for a 
    distributed pyTree. A distributed pyTree means that zones are
    distributed on different processors.<br>

<strong> Distance field for a distributed pyTree.</strong><br><br><br>

<p>
   The first script is only used to setup the case.
   Second script performs the computation of wall distance. 
   It is executed on each processor and must be launched with 
   <span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;">mpirun -np 10 python dist2Walls.py.</span>

   It loads walls.cgns on every processors, then it loads only the skeleton
   of the pyTree to be computed. Then a distribution is performed
   to determine which zone must be loaded on each processor.
   Since wall distance computation doesn't require any communications
   once the walls are defined, useCom=0 and fast algorithm are chosen.
   
   Then, only certain zones are loaded on processor according to the 
   distribution using <span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;">C.readZones</span>. Skeleton tree is then converted to
   a partial tree, that is a tree where only loaded zones are defined.
   Dist2Walls are computed on local zones.

   Finally, each processor write its zones to a common file using
   <span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;">Cmpi.convertPyTree2File</span>.<br><br>
